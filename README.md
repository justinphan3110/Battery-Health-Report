# Battery-Health-Report
USING R AND JAVA to Get and Analyzed your laptop battery health report. Compare the current with design capacity

The battery capacity will decrease over time. This application will help you to track the current capacity compared to the design capacity

After scan successful you will received the information of your computer. Now you have to option, you can either choose the short result
to get the percentage of design capacity or a details one which will thoroughly analyze the battery health since you bought the laptop.

two windows of a point plot and a csv file will pop up give the the data how your battery capacity decrease over time

### Prerequisites

I will use cmd commnad to generate a battery-report.html and using Jsoup.jar to parsing this file and read it into a csv file. 

I will then use [Renjin](http://www.renjin.org/about.html) to intergrate [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) into [JVM](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/jvm-works-jvm-architecture/) to clean and analyze this batter data base on each week since the laptop was bought.

The html file will give us the data as

I will then use BufferedReader to read this .html file

After the data has been read. CSVWriter from the [OpenCSV](https://sourceforge.net/projects/opencsv/) can be used to write these data into a .csv file
.csv file can then be used by R language to clean and analyze. 
I use [Renjin](http://www.renjin.org/about.html) instead of [JRI](https://www.rforge.net/JRI/index.html) because Renjin will run on JVM and not require and JRI 
require installed R on the computer to implement. Renjin can be set up in Java IDE as

engine.eval command just simply pass the command into normal R Terminal to execute the data.frame

The data after been clean and analyze in BatteryReport.csv, I use [JFreeChart](http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/) to draw a scatter point plot analyze how the capacity of laptop
battery decrease in terms of weeks since it was first used.

Most of the API is build based on javaFX


# Installing
#### :fast_forward:Option 1: Download the [BatteryHealthReport(forUser) folder](https://github.com/justinphan3110/Battery-Health-Report/tree/master/BatteryHealthReport%20(for%20User)) and unzip the withJava.zip if your computer have Java (64-bit) installed OR unzip the NoJava.zip if your computer does not have java installed 
###### (:heavy_exclamation_mark:note: keep the jar and the .exe file in the same folder).

##### Click on battery.exe to run

###### Note: If you run on the version of WithJava and the application stop working after you click scan, there may be a chance that your laptop is using Java 32-bit. Therefore, you can either change it back to 64 bits or use the NoJava.rar version.
